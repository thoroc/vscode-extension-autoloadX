# Story 7.3: Automate GitHub Issue Creation for Stories

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to automate the creation of GitHub issues for each PRD-story,
**so that** I can ensure consistency, reduce manual effort, and improve traceability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A GitHub Action is implemented to create issues for all PRD-stories in the repository.
2. Issues include the following metadata:
   - Title matching the PRD-story title.
   - Labels for priority, epic, and status.
   - A link back to the corresponding PRD-story.
3. The workflow is triggered manually or via a scheduled job.
4. Issues are created without duplications when the workflow is re-run.
5. The workflow is tested and validated in a staging environment.
