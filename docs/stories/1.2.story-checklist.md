Checklist run for: `docs/stories/1.2.story.md`

- Title: Implement Project Context Scanner
- Goal: Detect project languages and dependencies by scanning workspace files and .gitignore
- Acceptance: Scanner identifies language/dependency files, respects .gitignore, returns unique contexts, and is tested
- Value: Enables context-aware extension management, reduces manual config
- Dependencies: VSCode workspace events, file system access, .gitignore parsing
- Implementation: src/services/contextScanner.test.ts, test/fixtures/sample-python-node/requirements.txt,
  test/fixtures/with-gitignore/.gitignore, test/fixtures/with-gitignore/node_modules/package.json
- Files: src/services/contextScanner.test.ts, test/fixtures/sample-python-node/requirements.txt,
  test/fixtures/with-gitignore/.gitignore, test/fixtures/with-gitignore/node_modules/package.json
- Handoff: Story marked Ready for Review, one open task (trigger on workspace open)
- QA: Automated tests confirm correct detection and .gitignore handling, full coverage
- Status: Draft, Ready for Review (pending trigger implementation)

Result: Story 1.2 meets most checklist criteria. One open task remains (trigger scanner on workspace open). Otherwise,
ready for review.
