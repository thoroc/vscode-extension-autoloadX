# Story 7.5: Validate and Close Issues Based on Story Checklist

**As a** Developer,
 **I want** to ensure that GitHub issues are revisited and validated when related work is merged,
**so that** I can close them based on the story checklist.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A GitHub Action is implemented to trigger on work merge events.
2. The related GitHub issue is validated against the story checklist.
3. The issue is closed if all checklist items are completed.
4. The status of the story/issue is updated and reflected in the assigned GitHub label.
5. The workflow is tested and validated in a staging environment.
