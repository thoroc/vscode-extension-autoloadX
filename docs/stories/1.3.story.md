# Story 1.3: Create Recommendation Engine from Default Mappings

## Tasks

- [x] Load default mapping of project contexts to recommended extension IDs from a bundled JSON file
- [x] Retrieve the list of all extensions currently installed by the user
- [x] Given a list of detected project contexts, identify which installed extensions should be enabled
- [x] Identify all other managed extensions that are currently enabled but are not relevant to the detected contexts,
      marking them for disabling
- [x] Produce a clear data structure containing two lists: `extensionsToEnable` and `extensionsToDisable`

## Dev Agent Record

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes

- Implemented `src/services/recommendationEngine.ts` to load mappings, get installed extensions, and recommend
  enables/disables.
- Added tests in `src/services/recommendationEngine.test.ts` with a manual `vscode` mock.
- Tests confirm correct enable/disable recommendations for various detected contexts and extension states.
