# Story 7.4: Mark Epic as Completed When All Stories Are Done

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to check the status of all associated stories/issues and mark the epic as completed when all stories are marked as completed,
**so that** I can ensure epics reflect the true state of progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A GitHub Action is implemented to check the status of all associated stories/issues for an epic.
2. The epic is marked as completed if all associated stories/issues are marked as completed.
3. The status of the epic is updated and reflected in the assigned GitHub label.
4. The workflow is triggered manually or via a scheduled job.
5. The workflow is tested and validated in a staging environment.
