# Story 7.1: Create GitHub Issue for New Epic

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to automatically create a GitHub issue when a new epic is detected in the PRD,
**so that** I can ensure all epics are tracked consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A GitHub Action is implemented to detect new epics in the PRD.
2. A GitHub issue is created for each new epic with the following metadata:
   - Title matching the epic title.
   - Labels for priority, epic, and status.
   - A link back to the corresponding PRD epic.
3. The workflow is triggered manually or via a scheduled job.
4. Issues are created without duplications when the workflow is re-run.
5. The workflow is tested and validated in a staging environment.
