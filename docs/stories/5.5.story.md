# User Story 5.5: Automate Issue Label Updates Using Gemini CLI

## Goal

Use the Gemini CLI integration to automate the process of updating issue labels. Specifically, every time a new story is
posted as an issue on the repository or an existing issue is updated, the action will be triggered. The action will
check if all the tasks in the issue have been completed and, if so, change the label from "in progress" to "completed."

## User Roles

- **Maintainer:** Wants to ensure that issue labels are updated automatically to reflect the current status of tasks.
- **Contributor:** Wants clear feedback on the status of their issues without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The GitHub Action is triggered whenever a new issue is created or an existing issue is updated.
2. The action uses the Gemini CLI to check the status of all tasks in the issue.
3. If all tasks are marked as completed, the issue label is updated from "in progress" to "completed."
4. If tasks are incomplete, the label remains unchanged.
5. Clear logs are generated for each action run, detailing the status of tasks and any label changes.
6. Documentation is updated to include details about this new functionality.
