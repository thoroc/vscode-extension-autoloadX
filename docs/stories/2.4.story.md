# Story 2.4: Define Default Mappings in Code

**As a** Developer, **I want** the default mappings to be defined as part of the codebase, **so that** the extension has
a reliable baseline configuration while still allowing users to override it.

## System Flow

This story is part of the configuration management workflow. It ensures that default mappings are defined in the
codebase, providing a reliable baseline configuration while allowing user overrides. The recommendation engine will
merge these mappings with user-defined ones.

## Dependencies

- **Story 2.2**: Implements user-defined settings overrides.

## Technical Implementation Details

- **Files to Modify**:
  - `src/config/defaultMappings.ts`: Define the default mappings.
  - `src/services/recommendationEngine.ts`: Implement logic for merging user-defined and default mappings.
- **APIs to Use**:
  - VSCode API for accessing `settings.json`.
- **Data Models**:
  - Mapping Metadata: Includes default and user-defined mappings.

## References

- `docs/architecture/components.md#default-mappings`: Details on default mappings and overrides.
- `docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#recommendation-engine`: Explanation of the recommendation engine.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The default mappings are hardcoded in the extension's codebase.
2. Users can redefine part or all of the default mappings through the `settings.json` file.
3. The recommendation engine merges user-defined mappings with the default mappings, with user-defined mappings taking
   precedence.
4. Documentation is updated to explain the default mappings and how users can override them.
