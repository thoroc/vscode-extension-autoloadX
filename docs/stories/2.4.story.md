# Story 2.4: Define Default Mappings in Code

**As a** Developer, **I want** the default mappings to be defined as part of the codebase, **so that** the extension has a reliable baseline configuration while still allowing users to override it.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The default mappings are hardcoded in the extension's codebase.
2. Users can redefine part or all of the default mappings through the `settings.json` file.
3. The recommendation engine merges user-defined mappings with the default mappings, with user-defined mappings taking precedence.
4. Documentation is updated to explain the default mappings and how users can override them.
