# Story 1.6: Error Handling and User Feedback for Extension Actions

## Tasks

- [x] Notify user via VSCode notification if an extension enable/disable action fails
- [x] Log all errors to the "AutoLoadX" output channel with relevant details (extension name, action attempted, error
      message)
- [x] Gracefully handle cases where an extension cannot be enabled/disabled due to VSCode API limitations or permission
      issues
- [x] Attempt remaining actions even if one fails, and inform user of partial success/failure
- [x] Provide a summary notification after all actions, indicating which changes succeeded and which failed
- [x] Ensure all error and success messages are accessible (screen reader friendly, clear language)
