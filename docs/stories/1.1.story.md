# Story 1.1: Technical Spike: Validate Extension Management API

## Tasks

- [x] Identify a specific, pre-defined VSCode extension for testing
- [x] Programmatically enable the target extension if it is disabled
- [x] Programmatically disable the target extension if it is enabled
- [x] Ensure enable/disable actions do NOT require a full VSCode window reload
- [x] Document results and any limitations of the VSCode API

## Dev Agent Record

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes

- The spike successfully identifies the `thoroc-autoloadX` extension using the VSCode API.
- Enabling an extension can be achieved by calling `ext.activate()`. This does not require a full VSCode window reload.
- Disabling an extension programmatically is not directly supported by the VSCode API. The workaround is to execute the
  command `workbench.extensions.action.disableExtension`, which prompts VSCode to disable the extension, but may require
  user confirmation and may not take effect until the next reload.
- All actions provide user feedback via VSCode notifications.
- Limitations: Full programmatic control over enable/disable without reload is not possible for disabling; enabling
  works as expected. This is a known VSCode API limitation as of August 2025.
