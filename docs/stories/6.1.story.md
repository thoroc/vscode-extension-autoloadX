# Story 6.1: Integrate ESLint for Code Quality

## Goal

Ensure consistent code quality and enforce coding standards across the project.

## User Role

Contributor

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ESLint is configured with a standard ruleset (e.g., Airbnb or custom rules).
2. ESLint runs automatically on staged files during pre-commit.
3. Contributors can run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues.
4. Documentation is updated to include instructions for running and fixing linting issues.

## Tasks

- Research and select an appropriate ESLint ruleset.
- Configure ESLint in the project (`.eslintrc.json` or equivalent).
- Add ESLint as a dev dependency in `package.json`.
- Update the pre-commit hook to run ESLint on staged files.
- Write documentation for contributors on using ESLint.
