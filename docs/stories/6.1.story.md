# Story 6.1: Integrate ESLint for Code Quality

## Goal

Ensure consistent code quality and enforce coding standards across the project.

## User Role

Contributor

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ESLint is configured with a standard ruleset (e.g., Airbnb or custom rules).
2. ESLint runs automatically on staged files during pre-commit using Lefthook.
3. Contributors can run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues.
4. Documentation is updated to include instructions for running and fixing linting issues.
5. Lefthook is installed and configured to manage Git hooks.
6. ESLint fixes staged files and stages the fixed files automatically.

## Tasks

- Research and select an appropriate ESLint ruleset.
- Configure ESLint in the project (`.eslintrc.json` or equivalent).
- Add ESLint as a dev dependency in `package.json`.
- Install and configure Lefthook to manage Git hooks.
- Update the pre-commit hook to run ESLint on staged files using Lefthook.
- Ensure ESLint fixes staged files and stages the fixed files automatically.
- Write documentation for contributors on using ESLint and Lefthook.
