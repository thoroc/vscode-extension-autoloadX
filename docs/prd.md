# VSCode Extension Auto-loader Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **User-Facing Goals:**
  - Streamline the development workflow by automatically managing VSCode extensions based on project context.
  - Improve VSCode performance (startup time, responsiveness) by disabling irrelevant extensions.
  - Provide a \"just works\" experience that is intuitive for both new and experienced developers.
  - Guide new users toward best-practice extensions for their projects.
- **Project Goals:**
  - Achieve 10,000+ installs and 5,000+ active users within 6 months.
  - Maintain a 4.5+ star rating on the VSCode Marketplace.
  - Become a recognized and respected tool within the developer community.

### Background Context

Developers working in polyglot environments waste significant time manually enabling and disabling VSCode extensions to
match the needs of their current project. This friction not only hampers productivity but also leads to editor
performance degradation when too many extensions are active simultaneously. Existing solutions lack intelligent,
automatic context-switching capabilities.

This PRD outlines the requirements for \"AutoLoadX,\" a VSCode extension that solves this problem by detecting a
project's technical stack and recommending the appropriate extensions to activate or deactivate. By offering an
automated yet user-supervised workflow, the extension will provide a seamless, efficient, and tailored development
experience, allowing developers to focus on coding rather than editor configuration.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **FR1: Project Context Detection:** The extension MUST scan the active workspace upon opening to detect project
   context. This includes identifying:
   - File extensions (e.g., `.py`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.java`).
   - Key dependency management files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`).
   - Specific configuration filenames (e.g., `Dockerfile`, `terraform.tf`).
2. **FR2: Extension State Inspection:** The extension MUST be able to inspect the user's installed extensions and
   identify their current activation state (enabled or disabled).
3. **FR3: Recommendation Generation:** Based on the detected project context, the extension MUST generate a set of
   recommendations for enabling or disabling specific extensions. This logic will be based on a predefined, configurable
   mapping that is hardcoded in the codebase but can be overridden by user settings.
4. **FR4: Interactive Approval Prompt:** The extension MUST display a single, clear, modal dialog to the user that lists
   all recommended changes (enables and disables).
5. **FR5: User-Controlled Execution:** From the approval prompt, the user MUST have the option to approve or reject the
   entire set of recommendations.
6. **FR6: Extension State Modification:** Upon user approval, the extension MUST programmatically enable and disable the
   recommended extensions.
7. **FR7: Action Logging:** All actions taken by the extension (e.g., \"Enabled Python extension,\" \"Disabled Go
   extension\") MUST be logged to a dedicated \"Output\" channel within VSCode for transparency and debugging.
8. **FR8: Configuration via `settings.json`:** Users MUST be able to configure the extension's behavior via VSCode's
   `settings.json` file. This includes:
   - Whitelisting extensions that should never be disabled.
   - Blacklisting extensions that should never be managed.
   - Overriding or extending the default context-to-extension mappings.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR1: Performance:** The extension's own performance overhead MUST be minimal. The initial project scan should
   complete quickly (e.g., within 2-3 seconds for a typical project), and the extension should not noticeably increase
   VSCode's startup time or memory consumption.
2. **NFR2: Transparency:** The extension's actions must be completely transparent to the user. All changes must be
   explicitly approved and logged. There should be no \"magic\" or unexpected behavior.
3. **NFR3: Reliability:** The extension must reliably detect project contexts and manage extensions without errors. It
   should gracefully handle edge cases, such as workspaces with no recognizable project type.
4. **NFR4: User Trust:** The extension's design and workflow must prioritize building user trust. It should be
   conservative in its recommendations and always give the user final control. It must never perform a destructive or
   irreversible action.
5. **NFR5: Security:** The extension must not collect any user data or telemetry. All configuration and logs will be
   stored locally on the user's machine. It will only interact with the VSCode Extension API and the local file system
   for configuration.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals (Revised)

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be \*\*effort
