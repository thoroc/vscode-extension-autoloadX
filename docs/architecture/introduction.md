# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for AutoLoadX, including backend systems, frontend
implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring
consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents,
streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly
intertwined.
