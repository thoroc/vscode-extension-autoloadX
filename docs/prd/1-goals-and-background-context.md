# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **User-Facing Goals:**
  - Streamline the development workflow by automatically managing VSCode extensions based on project context.
  - Improve VSCode performance (startup time, responsiveness) by disabling irrelevant extensions.
  - Provide a "just works" experience that is intuitive for both new and experienced developers.
  - Guide new users toward best-practice extensions for their projects.
- **Project Goals:**
  - Achieve 10,000+ installs and 5,000+ active users within 6 months.
  - Maintain a 4.5+ star rating on the VSCode Marketplace.
  - Become a recognized and respected tool within the developer community.

## Background Context

Developers working in polyglot environments waste significant time manually enabling and disabling VSCode extensions to
match the needs of their current project. This friction not only hampers productivity but also leads to editor
performance degradation when too many extensions are active simultaneously. Existing solutions lack intelligent,
automatic context-switching capabilities.

This PRD outlines the requirements for "AutoLoadX," a VSCode extension that solves this problem by detecting a project's
technical stack and recommending the appropriate extensions to activate or deactivate. By offering an automated yet
user-supervised workflow, the extension will provide a seamless, efficient, and tailored development experience,
allowing developers to focus on coding rather than editor configuration.
