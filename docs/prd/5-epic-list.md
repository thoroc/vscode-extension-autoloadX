# 5. Epic List

1. **Epic 1: Core Engine & MVP Workflow:** Establish the foundational capabilities of the extension. This includes
    implementing the project scanning engine, the recommendation logic, and the core user workflow of prompting for and
    applying changes. The goal is to deliver a fully functional, end-to-end MVP that successfully manages extensions for
    a single workspace.
2. **Epic 2: Enhanced Configuration & User Control:** Build upon the MVP by providing users with robust configuration
    options. This includes implementing whitelists, blacklists, and the ability for users to define their own custom
    context-to-extension mappings directly in `settings.json`. The goal is to give power users full control over the
    extension's behavior.
