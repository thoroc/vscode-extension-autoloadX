# Epic 7: Managing PRD-Stories and GitHub-Issues Relationship

## Epic Goal

Streamline the relationship between PRD-stories and GitHub issues by automating workflows, ensuring traceability, and
improving collaboration efficiency.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- **Current relevant functionality:** GitHub issues are manually linked to PRD-stories, leading to inefficiencies and
  potential misalignment.
- **Technology stack:** GitHub Actions, Markdown PRDs, and existing project management tools.
- **Integration points:** GitHub repository, PRD documentation system.

**Enhancement Details:**

- **What's being added/changed:** Automate the creation, linking, and management of GitHub issues based on PRD-stories.
- **How it integrates:** Utilize GitHub Actions to trigger workflows that sync PRD-stories with GitHub issues.
- **Success criteria:**
  - All PRD-stories have corresponding GitHub issues.
  - Changes in PRD-stories automatically update linked GitHub issues.
  - Improved traceability and reduced manual effort.

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Automate GitHub Issue Creation

   ### Story Description

   Automate the creation of GitHub issues for each PRD-story to ensure consistency, reduce manual effort, and improve
   traceability.

   ### Scope

   - Develop a GitHub Action to parse PRD-stories and create corresponding GitHub issues.
   - Ensure issues are tagged and categorized based on PRD metadata (e.g., priority, epic, labels).
   - Validate that the workflow integrates seamlessly with the existing GitHub repository structure.

   ### Acceptance Criteria

   - [ ] A GitHub Action is implemented to create issues for all PRD-stories in the repository.
   - [ ] Issues include the following metadata:
     - Title matching the PRD-story title.
     - Labels for priority, epic, and status.
     - A link back to the corresponding PRD-story.
   - [ ] The workflow is triggered manually or via a scheduled job.
   - [ ] Issues are created without duplications when the workflow is re-run.
   - [ ] The workflow is tested and validated in a staging environment.

   ### Tasks

   - [ ] Design the GitHub Action workflow.
   - [ ] Implement a script to parse PRD-stories and extract metadata.
   - [ ] Configure the GitHub Action to create issues using the GitHub API.
   - [ ] Add error handling for cases like API rate limits or missing metadata.
   - [ ] Write unit tests for the script and integration tests for the workflow.
   - [ ] Document the workflow in the project README.

2. **Story 7.2:** Sync Updates Between PRD-Stories and GitHub Issues

   ### Story Description

   Ensure that updates to PRD-stories are reflected in their corresponding GitHub issues to maintain alignment and
   traceability.

   ### Scope

   - Implement a workflow to detect changes in PRD-stories.
   - Update the corresponding GitHub issue with the latest information.
   - Maintain a log of updates for traceability.

   ### Acceptance Criteria

   - [ ] A GitHub Action is implemented to detect changes in PRD-stories.
   - [ ] The corresponding GitHub issue is updated with the latest story details.
   - [ ] A log of updates is maintained and accessible.
   - [ ] The workflow is tested and validated in a staging environment.

   ### Tasks

   - [ ] Design the GitHub Action workflow for detecting story updates.
   - [ ] Implement a script to update GitHub issues with new story details.
   - [ ] Add error handling for cases like API rate limits or missing metadata.
   - [ ] Write unit tests for the script and integration tests for the workflow.
   - [ ] Document the workflow in the project README.

3. **Story 7.3:** Validate and Close Issues Based on Story Checklist

   ### Story Description

   Ensure that GitHub issues are revisited and validated when related work is merged, and close them based on the story
   checklist.

   ### Scope

   - Revisit the related GitHub issue when work is merged.
   - Use the story checklist to determine if the issue can be closed.
   - Update the status of the story/issue and reflect it in the assigned GitHub label.

   ### Acceptance Criteria

   - [ ] A GitHub Action is implemented to trigger on work merge events.
   - [ ] The related GitHub issue is validated against the story checklist.
   - [ ] The issue is closed if all checklist items are completed.
   - [ ] The status of the story/issue is updated and reflected in the assigned GitHub label.
   - [ ] The workflow is tested and validated in a staging environment.

   ### Tasks

   - [ ] Design the GitHub Action workflow for merge event triggers.
   - [ ] Implement a script to validate and close issues based on the story checklist.
   - [ ] Add error handling for cases like API rate limits or incomplete checklists.
   - [ ] Write unit tests for the script and integration tests for the workflow.
   - [ ] Document the workflow in the project README.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged.
- [ ] GitHub repository structure is preserved.
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Workflow errors leading to incorrect issue updates.
- **Mitigation:** Implement robust testing and validation for GitHub Actions.
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable workflows and revert to manual issue management if errors occur.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met.
- [ ] GitHub workflows tested and verified.
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new workflows.
- [ ] No regression in existing project management processes.

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Epic can be completed in a manageable number of stories, depending on scope.
- [ ] No architectural documentation is required.
- [ ] Enhancement follows existing patterns.
- [ ] Integration complexity is manageable.

**Risk Assessment:**

- [ ] Risk to existing system is low.
- [ ] Rollback plan is feasible.
- [ ] Testing approach covers existing functionality.
- [ ] Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points.

**Completeness Check:**

- [ ] Epic goal is clear and achievable.
- [ ] Stories are properly scoped.
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable.
- [ ] Dependencies are identified.

## Handoff to Story Manager

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running GitHub Actions and Markdown PRDs.
- Integration points: GitHub repository and PRD documentation system.
- Existing patterns to follow: GitHub Actions workflows.
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain repository structure and ensure minimal performance impact.
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact.

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering automated and traceable PRD-story and GitHub-issue
management."
