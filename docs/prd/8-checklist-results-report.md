# 8. Checklist Results Report

## Final Decision: READY FOR ARCHITECT

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.

## Summary

- **Overall PRD Completeness:** 95%
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
- **Critical Gaps:** One minor gap was identified and is noted below. It does not block architectural design.

## Key Findings

- **PASS:** The PRD excels in defining the problem, MVP scope, user experience, functional requirements, and technical
  guidance. The epics and stories are well-structured and logical.
- **PARTIAL:** The "Cross-Functional Requirements" section was not explicitly present. While the client-side nature of
  the project makes these minimal, explicitly stating their absence improves clarity.

## Recommendation

- **Action:** For future PRDs of this nature, add a "Cross-Functional Requirements" section that explicitly states the
  absence of server-side data, integration, or operational needs for the MVP. This is a minor clarification and is not
  required for this document to proceed.
