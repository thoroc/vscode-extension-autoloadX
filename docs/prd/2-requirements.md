# 2. Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. **FR1: Project Context Detection:** The extension MUST scan the active workspace upon opening to detect project
    context. This includes identifying:
    - File extensions (e.g., `.py`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.java`).
    - Key dependency management files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`).
    - Specific configuration filenames (e.g., `Dockerfile`, `terraform.tf`).
2. **FR2: Extension State Inspection:** The extension MUST be able to inspect the user's installed extensions and
    identify their current activation state (enabled or disabled).
3. **FR3: Recommendation Generation:** Based on the detected project context, the extension MUST generate a set of
    recommendations for enabling or disabling specific extensions. This logic will be based on a predefined,
    configurable mapping.
4. **FR4: Interactive Approval Prompt:** The extension MUST display a single, clear, modal dialog to the user that
    lists all recommended changes (enables and disables).
5. **FR5: User-Controlled Execution:** From the approval prompt, the user MUST have the option to approve or reject the
    entire set of recommendations.
6. **FR6: Extension State Modification:** Upon user approval, the extension MUST programmatically enable and disable
    the recommended extensions.
7. **FR7: Action Logging:** All actions taken by the extension (e.g., "Enabled Python extension," "Disabled Go
    extension") MUST be logged to a dedicated "Output" channel within VSCode for transparency and debugging.
8. **FR8: Configuration via `settings.json`:** Users MUST be able to configure the extension's behavior via VSCode's
    `settings.json` file. This includes:
    - Whitelisting extensions that should never be disabled.
    - Blacklisting extensions that should never be managed.
    - Overriding or extending the default context-to-extension mappings.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR1: Performance:** The extension's own performance overhead MUST be minimal. The initial project scan should
    complete quickly (e.g., within 2-3 seconds for a typical project), and the extension should not noticeably increase
    VSCode's startup time or memory consumption.
2. **NFR2: Transparency:** The extension's actions must be completely transparent to the user. All changes must be
    explicitly approved and logged. There should be no "magic" or unexpected behavior.
3. **NFR3: Reliability:** The extension must reliably detect project contexts and manage extensions without errors. It
    should gracefully handle edge cases, such as workspaces with no recognizable project type.
4. **NFR4: User Trust:** The extension's design and workflow must prioritize building user trust. It should be
    conservative in its recommendations and always give the user final control. It must never perform a destructive or
    irreversible action.
5. **NFR5: Security:** The extension must not collect any user data or telemetry. All configuration and logs will be
    stored locally on the user's machine. It will only interact with the VSCode Extension API and the local file system
    for configuration.
